The example configuration is located in /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/.

Copy/install bspwmrc from there into ~/.config/bspwm/ or run the command:<br/>
install -Dm755 /usr/share/doc/bspwm/examples/bspwmrc ~/.config/bspwm/bspwmrc

The file bspwmrc needs to be executable since the default example is simply a shell script that in turn configures bspwm via the bspc command.
